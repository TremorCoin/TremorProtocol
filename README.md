# Tremor Coin / Tremor Protocol Systems

The worldâ€™s first Peer-to-Peer Wireless payment DAPP powered by blockchain technology.  Wireless is becoming more and more prominent in modern day society. We are aimed at automating all day to day transactions. We believe in a future where you can leave your wallet at home.

Our Goals:
POW (Proof of Work + Proof of Location/Stake) - By being involved in the network and having a location that accepts the coin, you receive currency overtime.
Wifi Direct and Bluetooth Beacons for proximity detection/identification/location verification.

## Our Current Roadmap

- Encrypted Wireless Currency Platform
- Blockchain-Based smart contracts
- Insurance Model (Automated scam prevention on Wireless payments lock funds in a
multisignature wallet until both parties confirm the transaction, simple and more reliable
than Ethereum Smart Contracts)
- Business Development Toolkit: Aims to package resources that assist businesses in
accepting this currency. (Legal Info, Web API, Physical hardware device for Wifi Direct
Server/Shop)
- Software Development Platform EDU: A kit for software devs to use this coin in
games/apps/etc. Crowdfunding Smart Contract API + Tutorials? Proximity Tipping?
- Personal Proximity Shop/Platform (PPS): A Personal shop that goes wherever you go.
This can be an advertisement, an ecommerce shop, eservices, services, social (resume
posting to people nearby) or more. We can either create one application or a platform for
other applications to be built off of.
- Atomic Swaps (Coin to other coin seamless exchange/trading)
